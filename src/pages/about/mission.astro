    <h1>Mission, Vision, & Values</h1>
    <h2>MISSION</h2>
    <p>The Kentucky Geological Survey is a state supported research center and public resource within the University of Kentucky. Our mission is to support sustainable prosperity of the Commonwealth, the vitality of its flagship university, and the welfare of its people. We do this by conducting research and providing unbiased information about geologic resources, environmental issues, and natural hazards affecting Kentucky.</p>
    <h2>VISION</h2>
    <p>To be the primary source of geologic information about and for Kentucky.</p>
    <h2>VALUES</h2>
    <p>An increased pool of knowledge and expertise leads to greater ingenuity and provides competitive advantages that increase institutional excellence. The Survey cannot exist without staff, collaborators, and stakeholders with a breadth of experience. KGS prides itself on being a supportive professional environment. As researchers, we encourage scholarly freedom in asking the big questions required of today's geoscientists.</p>
    <p>We at KGS continue our long-standing commitment to provide unbiased scientific information to Kentuckians. We do not advocate on behalf of policy options.</p>

        <h3>Supporting Initiatives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We advertise full-time geologist job series and related professional job openings nationally on a variety of professional and association career boards to attract a broader group of applicants.</li>
            <li>We form search committees to make consensus hiring recommendations to the director for full-time geologist and related professional job openings. We try to make all committees represent a sample of KGS perspectives.</li>
            <li>For our governor-appointed advisory board, we seek out a wide pool of nominees from a variety of sources across the Commonwealth.</li>
            <li>Ongoing research collaborations help us identify and engage with underserved non-traditional KGS stakeholders from both rural areas and urban centers throughout Kentucky.</li>
            <li>KGS supports a wide variety of professional development programs and associations. The Survey encourages employee participation in these organizations to facilitate innovation, communication, and collaboration.</li>
            <li>We are affiliated with programs such as the Kentucky Climate Consortium and the NIEHS-funded UK Center for Appalachian Research on Environmental Sciences (UK-CARES), which include commitments to translational and citizen science, a resolution of socially and economically driven health disparities, and studying environmental impacts on communities.</li>
            <li>To encourage community and collaboration, we support a research seminar series, walking meetings, and informal whiteboard feedback sessions.</li>
        </ul>
